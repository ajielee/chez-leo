Two days after dotJS 2016, I finally have time to write down some notes.

This was my first time go to an international developer conference. Everything was brand new to me, and I was so exited.
<!-- more -->
To be honest, there are many things on the show which I don't understand at all, a half is because my poor English, and the other half is because my low JS level. Therefore, correct me if I say something wrong, thank you.

In all the four sessions, I took some notes from the following presentations.

## Service Worker and the Appification of the Web

Speacker: [Nolan Lawson](https://nolanlawson.com/)
Slide: [nolanlawson.github.io/dotjs-2016](nolanlawson.github.io/dotjs-2016)

Nolan mentioned an interesting point: 

At the beginning of HTML5, there were sereval threats  of single-vendor solutions like: Flash & Silverlight. In many ways, they were just better. So not long ago, we saw _*Best viewed with Flash*_ & _*Best viewed with Silverlight*_ everywhere. Finally, HTML5 won! But look what we got today? _*Download on the App Store*_ & _*GET IT ON Google Play*_. That sounds familiar, right?

> There's a new existential threat... It's not Flash and Silverlight ‚Äì it's native apps, [which are] feeding off the web, and arguably killing the web.
> **Bruce Lawson (2016)** - [From Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxQUxCsNomM)

For overcoming the new threat, we got **Progressive Web Apps**. 

But, wait! What's "Progressive Web Apps"? That's my first time heard about it. So I did some ~~research~~ google, then [here it is](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/your-first-pwapp/#0). 

Briefly speaking, we make webs with new technologies like HTTPS, Service Worker and Web App Manifest, so that we can fake an App experience for user. Although it's a good idea, still there are obstacles: Only HTTPS, Ephemeral, Permission, etc.

We can't do this right now, but as the web develops at a high speed, it should be there soon.
