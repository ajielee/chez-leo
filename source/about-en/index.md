## Who am I?

Hi there, welcome to my blog, I'm Leo, a web developer who live in Paris.

## What's in my blog?

- **Coding**: Like I said, I'm a web developer, and I love so much programming, because it feels so good that I can create something as I want. I will write down the problems which I faced during my work, and the new things which I'm learning.
- **Life**: I try to enjoy my life while I'm working hard everyday. In general, I like travelling and see different culture in the world. Then I like taking photos of the landscapes which I saw during the journey. So I will write down the travel notes with some beautiful photos. Beside, here you can find some of my photos: [Instagram](https://instagram.com/leo_li/) & [500px](https://500px.com/XiaojieLI). By the way, I'm a gamer and a foodie, maybe I will also post some articles in these topics.
